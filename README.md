# Scripts to help with using a Samsung Xpress M2070 multifunction printer over USB

Installation script based on instructions found [here](http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/). Also uses the apt repo from there.

## Usage

`./install.sh` adds the repo to `/etc/apt/souces.list` with `apt-add-repository` and installs the driver.

./scan.sh helps you scan files and provides a hopefully easy-to-follow workflow.

TODO add print.sh
